## Habitat Name and Description


## Location

![Location of sample area](img/oderbank_overview.png)

The examplary mussel banks on fine sand occur in the Pomeranian Bay/Southern Baltic Sea, southwest to the prominent morphological feature of the Oder Bank. The area is relatively flat, with water depth around 14 to 16 m.

## Ground Truthing Data
### Geology
Results from HAPS cores at 4 sampling stations (EMB205-10, 11, 16, 17) show a homogeneous grain size distribution, in the range of fine to medium sand. No lateral variations appear, but horizontally, an increased amount of shell fragments occurs in depth greater than 8 cm, especially at stations EMB205-10. Generally, the seafloor surface is characterized by small sand ripples and very similar at all sampling stations (Figures \ref{fig:uw_video} and \ref{fig:haps}).


### Biology
According to HUB classification of Benthic habitats at Level 3, the entire area is “coarse sediment and sand”, and most of it is classified as 
AB-J3L9 Baltic aphotic sand dominated by multiple infaunal bivalve species: Cerastoderma spp., Mya arenaria, Astarte borealis, Arctica islandica, Macoma balthica.

*Abundance and biomass of dominant species at each sampling site. Species contributing to over 96% of total abundance and 98% of total wet weight biomass are shown.*

*Exemplary UW photos of two major groups (resulting from Hierarchical Cluster and Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis based on coverage data; significance of differences between groups in confirmed by ANOSIM).*

Group c is characterised by relatively high coverage by unattached mussel clusters.
Sand was observed in images of Group d with average coverage over 60 %, indicating infauna-dominated habitat.
