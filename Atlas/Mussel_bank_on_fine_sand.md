# Mussel bank on fine sand

## Habitat Name and Description


## Location

![Location of sample area](img/oderbank_overview.png)

The examplary mussel banks on fine sand occur in the Pomeranian Bay/Southern Baltic Sea, southwest to the prominent morphological feature of the Oder Bank. The area is relatively flat, with water depth around 14 to 16 m.

During the Quaternary, Scandinavian ice sheets overprinted the region repeatedly \cite{Andren2011}. Following deglaciation, complex interaction of the isostatic movements and sea level fluctuations led to various changes of the regime between freshwater and salt water to a nowadays brackish Baltic Sea \cite{Bjorck1995}. Buried glacial deposits are widely covered by an extended layer of mainly fine sands \cite{tauber2012meeresbodensedimente}. The well-sorted sand is partly enriched with high amounts of shell fragments (REF). The Pomeranian Bay with the Oder Bank is a protected area under the Habitats Directive (REF) and part of the yearly biological monitoring of IOW, the initial reason for the choosing the survey site.

## Ground Truthing Data
### Geology
Results from HAPS cores at 4 sampling stations (EMB205-10, 11, 16, 17) show a homogeneous grain size distribution, in the range of fine to medium sand. No lateral variations appear, but horizontally, an increased amount of shell fragments occurs in depth greater than 8 cm, especially at stations EMB205-10. Generally, the seafloor surface is characterized by small sand ripples and very similar at all sampling stations (Figures \ref{fig:uw_video} and \ref{fig:haps}).
