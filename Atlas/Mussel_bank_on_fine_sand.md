# Mussel bank on fine sand

## Habitat Name and Description


## Location

![Location of sample area](img/oderbank_overview.png)

The examplary mussel banks on fine sand occur in the Pomeranian Bay/Southern Baltic Sea, southwest to the prominent morphological feature of the Oder Bank. The area is relatively flat, with water depth around 14 to 16 m.

## Ground Truthing Data
### Geology
Results from HAPS cores at 4 sampling stations (EMB205-10, 11, 16, 17) show a homogeneous grain size distribution, in the range of fine to medium sand. No lateral variations appear, but horizontally, an increased amount of shell fragments occurs in depth greater than 8 cm, especially at stations EMB205-10. Generally, the seafloor surface is characterized by small sand ripples and very similar at all sampling stations (Figures \ref{fig:uw_video} and \ref{fig:haps}).
