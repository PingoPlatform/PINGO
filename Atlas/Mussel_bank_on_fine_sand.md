# Mussel bank on fine sand

## Location

![Location of sample area](img/oderbank_overview.png)

The examplary mussel banks on fine sand occur in the Pomeranian Bay/Southern Baltic Sea, southwest to the prominent morphological feature of the Oder Bank. The area is relatively flat, with water depth around 14 to 16 m.

## Ground Truthing Data
### Geology
Results from HAPS cores at 4 sampling stations (EMB205-10, 11, 16, 17) show a homogeneous grain size distribution, in the range of fine to medium sand. No lateral variations appear, but horizontally, an increased amount of shell fragments occurs in depth greater than 8 cm, especially at stations EMB205-10. Generally, the seafloor surface is characterized by small sand ripples and very similar at all sampling stations.

### Biology
According to HUB (HELCOM Undewater biotope and habitat classification system) classification of Benthic habitats at Level 3, the entire area is “coarse sediment and sand”, and most of it is classified as AB-J3L9 Baltic aphotic sand dominated by multiple infaunal bivalve species (Schiele et al., 2015).

Group c is characterised by relatively high coverage by unattached mussel clusters. However, at observed images colony size does not exceed first few cm and is barely visible, exhibiting very low coverage (a maximum of 4% in our data). Sand was observed in images of Group d with average coverage over 60 %, indicating infauna-dominated habitat.

## Acoustic/Optical Data

Parallel stripes of high-backscatter strength appear in the central part of the investigation area with a very regular spacing of ~50 m. The stripes are oriented in NW-SE direction. The increase of backscatter intensity to the surrounding seafloor is similar in all four considered frequencies (200, 400, 550, and 700 kHz).
