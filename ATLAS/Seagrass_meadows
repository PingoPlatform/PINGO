## Location
![Location of sample area](img/cgs_03.png)
The sample CGS area HOHE DÜNE is located in water depths of approx. 5 m in the southern baltic Sea directly offshore Rostock-Warnemünde.

## Ground Truthing Data
### Geology
In the sample area, two habitats of high and low backscatter intensity, respectively. A relation of camera data, grab samples (Table \ref{tab:geolsamples}) and backscatter information shows that darker areas of lower backscatter intensity intensity are composed of fine to medium sand, while an increasing amount of coarse sand and gravel and extended ripple fields are observed in the areas of bluish appearance (Figure  \ref{fig:fine_scale_KGS}). In bathymetric data, the coarser seafloor is located slightly below the finer grained material, pointing to a hydrodynamic origin of fine sediments covering a coarser substratum. In area A, the higher backscatter sediments dominate, while in area D, lower backscatter intensity sediments prevail.

### Biology
The similarity of community structure of the two stations considered to be concisely located within the CSG habitat (HD13 and HD16) is relatively low (Figure \ref{fig:HD_Bio_fig1}). Community displays lowest total biomass, total abundance and specie richness. The biomass at station HD13 in April and August was dominated by blue mussels (\textit{M. edulis}), but the species was completely absent in October samples. The second species in terms of biomass dominance was\textit{ P. ulvae}. Characteristic taxa revealed for this habitat by Indicator Value analysis based on biomass were polychaetes \textit{Capitella capitate}, H\textit{ediste diversicolor}, and \textit{Paraonis fulgens}. Individuals of an oligochaete family Enchytraeidae were also found at both stations, however only once over three sampling events (at HD16 in August with abundance of 1150 ind/m$^2$ and biomass of 36 mg/m$^2$, and at HD13 in October, with 25 ind/m$^2$ and only 7 mg/m$^2$). Overall abundance was dominated by P. ulvae with a minimum of 100 ind/m$^2$ in spring and a maximum of 7325 ind/m$^2$ in autumn (when the contribution of taxa exceeded 95\% of relative abundance at both station). Traces of \textit{A. marina} were also observed with underwater imaging in this zone, though density was lower comparing to seagrass habitat, and shape of coiled castings was less pronounced due to sediment properties (Figure \ref{fig:HD_Bio_fig9}).

## Acoustic/Optical Data

As an exception to the guideline that low frequencies have a higher sensitivity to soft-sediments habitats where at least some volume scatter is present, the coarse-grained features are more clearly observed in high-frequency backscatter mosaics of 550 kHz and 700 kHz (with grain size approaching or exceeding the acoustic wavelength; e.g. station HD12, Table \ref{tab:geolsamples}). In the multispectral map (Figure \ref{fig:HD_freq_comp}), this can be utilized to quickly spot the ecologically valuable areas of coarse sand and gravel (CSG) by their bluish tint.

## Seasonality

Note the different appearance of seagrass of different abundance in the backscatter mosaics (medium row), and the appearance of hydrodynamically induced bedforms in facies D (lowermost row).*
